ISPAS Project Learning Materials Files Repository

Basing on the collaboration between academic and non-academic partners from Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, and Norway ISPAS’ overall objective is to develop new joint curricula of PhD courses. It will take place in both academic and non-academic surroundings to equip PhD candidates of the STEM Sciences, Medical Sciences, Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities with competences and skills in the areas of open innovation and open science to facilitate their employment after graduation in and outside of academia.

The new joint curricula of PhD skills courses will address the recommendation of reinforcing tools, resources and guidance in education, training, employment and other learning settings to support people in managing their lifelong learning pathways. The development of the courses will be organized based on the quadruple helix model of collaboration where consortium’s academic partners collaborate with consortium’s non-academic partners, representatives of industry and public sector, and involve governmental representatives and citizens.
